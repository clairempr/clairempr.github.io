_large_blockquote I thought as I was a lone to night I would write you a few lines to let you know that we are not all ded yet

Years ago I came into possession of a letter written in 1862 by Francis P. Black, a Lieutenant in the 10th Alabama Infantry, to a Miss Evey (Eveline) Johnston back in White Plains, Alabama. Black was a 26-year-old single farmer, originally from South Carolina, when he enlisted in the 10th Alabama in 1861. He belonged to Company H, known as the "Choccolocco Rifles", made up of men primarily from Calhoun County, Alabama.

Though according to the 1860 Federal Census Francis Black’s family was wealthy, he was not a particularly well-educated man. His spellings were idiosyncratic and make for challenging reading. It’s unclear whether he had romantic intentions towards Eveline Johnston, who was about 20 at the time, but he obviously considered her a good friend.

The engagement mentioned in this letter is the Battle of Dranesville, VA, Dec. 20, 1861. The wounded man called "H.C. Sprincels" seems to be Private William H. Sprinkles of Co. H, 10th AL, who received a gunshot wound to the knee at Dranesville and died Jan. 16, 1862. He was a 24-year-old farmer, also born in South Carolina. The letter seems to be dated Jan. 1, 1861, but both the location of the regiment and the mention of the battle indicate that it was 1862, and Black wrote a "1" by mistake. 

Black mentions building huts because the army had presumably settled into winter quarters. It was difficult for the armies to campaign during the winter months due to bad weather and even worse roads. Anticipating a long stay in one place, the soldiers would build semi-permanent structures so they could live more comfortably than in a tent.

Francis Black was later promoted to Captain of Co. H, 10th Alabama Infantry. He was killed at Turkey Ridge (Cold Harbor), Virginia on June 6, 1864, around the age of 29. Whatever her feelings for him might have been, Eveline Johnston held onto his letter, and so it got saved for posterity.
