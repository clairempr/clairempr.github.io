  <span class="first-word">n</span>February 26, 1865, a grieving Kate Derenberger sat down to write a letter to her sister Mary, informing her of their brother’s death at the infamous Andersonville prison in Georgia. Nineteen-year-old George Derenberger had been a private in the 9th West Virginia infantry.
</p>
    
      <p>Wounded and left on the field at Cloyd’s Mountain, Virginia on May 9th, 1864, he was captured by the Confederates and sent to Andersonville as a prisoner of war. He recovered from his wound but fell ill and died on August 28, 1864, just 3 days shy of his 20th birthday.</p>

      <p>According to his service record, he was a farmer, born in Meigs County, Ohio. He was described as 5 feet 7 inches tall, with a light complexion, blue eyes, and brown hair.</p>
    
      <p>George’s sister Kate, eighteen years old at the time and living in Middleport, Ohio, only learned of his death the following year. In her letter, she states that he died on the 27th of August, 1864, but the Andersonville register of prisoner deaths lists his death date as the 28th.</p>

      <p>Officially known as Camp Sumter, Andersonville was the largest and most famous of the Civil War prisons. At its most overcrowded it held more than 32,000 men, and nearly 13,000 of the 45,000 Union soldiers imprisoned there died. The most deaths came from diarrhea, scurvy, and dysentery as a result of poor sanitation, malnutrition, and overcrowded conditions. Men also suffered and died from disease and lack of shelter.</p>
    
      <p>George Derenberger’s cause of death was listed as “Dysteria” in the register of prisoner deaths. He is one of the nearly 13,000 soldiers buried in the Andersonville National Cemetery.</p>
