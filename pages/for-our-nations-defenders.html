  <span class="first-letter">I</span>
  <span class="first-word">n</span>February of 1886, as Congress was considering an increase in pensions for disabled Civil War veterans, Joseph Curren, a former Union officer, wrote to his congressman on behalf of his “comrades who suffer from amputations”.  Mr. Curren hoped that the Hon. W.C. Cooper would vote in favor of H. R. 4902, a bill to “extend the benefits of the act approved March 3, 1879, and the act of March 3, 1885, to certain pensioners whose disabilities are caused by amputation and increasing the rate therefor, and for other purposes.” William C. Cooper served in Congress from 1885 to 1891. I was unable to find  whether he voted in favor of the bill, which was superseded by H. R. 7640, or against it.

      <p>Created in 1862, the federal “invalid” pension system assisted former Union soldiers who were no long able to work as a result of service-related injuries. Pension amounts depended on rank and severity of injury. In the beginning, for example, a “totally disabled” private would receive just $8 per month. Though pension payments and the number of eligible pensioners increased over time, many disabled veterans were hard-pressed to support themselves and their families. Those who were still able to work in some capacity faced discrimination because people assumed that they could not do the job, or found them less deserving of being hired than those who were not receiving a pension.</p>

      <p>Joseph F. Curren had been a Lieutenant and First Adjutant in the 60th Ohio Infantry until he was wounded at the battle of Cold Harbor, losing his right arm below the elbow. According to an account that he submitted to The National Tribune in 1910, he later returned to the field but was not allowed to fight. Instead he joined the Veteran Reserve Corps, an organization for soldiers who were considered too disabled for active duty. After the war he served as an officer of the Freedmen’s Bureau in North Carolina before returning home to Delaware, Ohio to raise his growing family. Later he started the insurance office on whose stationery his letter was written.</p>
    
      <p>Having been successful in life, he turned his attention to his less fortunate comrades. “They count not these things,” he wrote of their sacrifices, “but that their little ones may have their place in life and society that these men have yielded for sake of the nation’s life.”</p>

    <p>Curren’s Insurance Office<br>Opposite Court House</p>

<p>Delaware, O., Feby 19th 1886</p>

<p>Hon. W.C. Cooper</p>

<p>Representative 9th Dist of Ohio at Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir: House Bill No. 4902 now before committee on Pensions has been brought to my attention, and am asked by my comrades, who suffer from amputations to write you, begging you to favor the passage of said bill. There are five men in this county whose patriotism cost each a limb – 4 were farmers and their occupation is now gone because their ability to pursue such vocation is destroyed.</p>

<p>One having his right arm yet, has turned house painter and does quite a fair job at it, but people dislike to employ him least he break his neck in their service, has a wife and one son seventeen years old. The son teaches school and is prosecuting studies so as to get through our university. This man lost his arm at “Peach Tree Creek” Color sergent receiving also a wound in his right leg from knee to hips in the flesh only – the sad intelligence killed his mother outright his pension is 24$. One other lost his right arm at “Mission Ridge” Peddles for a living, woolens in winter and laces and Ladies goods in summer, has an interesting family of children, is in Delaware to get the benefit of our public schools – having no part of the arm left, gets 37.50$ monthly. Geo Slack of the 26th O. V. Infty of our county lost his right arm above the elbow, is trying to make a living for his sister and aged parents by farming, gets 30$ per month. One other [a Mr Courter?] lost his leg below the knee gets 30$. This latter has a family that need attention that money cannot procure.</p>

<p>Prior to the resumption of specie payments and while our national debt seemed a burden, these men kept silent and endured their lighter burdens patiently and are not clamorous now, but are quite pursuaded that the government can better afford now to assist in rearing their dependent ones and ask therefore that you will give your voice and vote for the bill now pending for and increas of their pensions and that the increase may date back as per bill. Tis difficult to sympathize with the bereft untill we are ourselves bereaved – so no one can appreciate the inconveniences these men have incurred, save those who are similarly dismembered.</p>

<p>In the minds of the people the word pension implies an equivalent, so in business these meet a barrier. Many for a small pension are boycotted, as some say “he gets a pension, let him live on it” so it is better to have none or an amt equal to a living. The property of our wealthy would be greatly incumbered by taxes for the 4,000,000 slaves liberated, the millions of cotton bales burned and for a war indemnity to a southern Confederacy had we not held out and held on to the last. These men are now sustaining burdens that press sorely on them, and the 9.000 are but one but a small portion of the 55,000,000 who enjoy the fruits of their sacrifice. Something might be said of the effects on physical condition from the cutting of nerves, muscles, veins and arteries. I relegate this to physicians. They count not these things – but that their little ones may only have the place in life and society that these men have yielded for sake of the nations life.</p>

<p>Now Mr Cooper I am perfectly satisfied that no word of this letter is necessary to procure your voice and vote in this matter because you mind and heart is in harmony with these mens wishes. Justice and mercy are the things you love and practice. You are the object of our admiration because we believe you possess in an eminent degree the attributes that make men great. I believe you will labor for the bill in its entirety and I am yours, for our Nations Defenders</p>

<p>J.F. Curren<br></p>
